# `git` Practice Session

## First, fork this repository from the upper right button.
This allows you to copy this repository that you own and play around with!

## Try add, commit, and push to your repository!
Remember `git add .`, `git commit -m "Message"`, and `git push`? Try those commands on your terminal (Mac) or command prompt (PC).
Refer to [this](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/routine.html) and push something to your repository that you just forked!

## Try pull request to MY repository for suggestion/changes in the code.
I should be able to see your changes and decide whether I accept your change or not!

### THIS IS HOW OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS WORK! WOW! IT'S AWESOME!!
